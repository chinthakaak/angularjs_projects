<!-- Service - A good way to think about an Angular service is as a 
set of tightly related functions, managed by the Angular,
which are made readily available for use across an application. 
For example, you might use something as
common as a company-wide data service, which enables any part of
your application to send and retrieve data to and
from a corporate database. -->
<!-- In Angular, services are not only about server communication and
data access but also getting a reference to the browser’s 
window object can also be achieved by using a service:
the built-in $window service. You can even create animations by 
using the built-in $animate service. -->

<!--What makes Angular Services pretty special

• When and where is the right place to instantiate my service?
• What is the best way to manage service dependencies across 
my application?
• What is the best approach for making sure that my services 
can be unit-tested and configurable?
• How should I handle persisting and sharing services between 
my controllers?

Of course, the answer to questions such as these, and many more 
just like them, have already been addressed by the Angular team.
As a developer, you need only learn some implementation details, 
but you can otherwise relax in the knowledge that you are using
a solid and well-thought-out solution. -->
